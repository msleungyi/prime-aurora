bio: "I am a doctoral researcher specialising in psycholinguistics and reading development. My work explores the cognitive mechanisms of how we learn to read, with a focus on subtyping dyslexia to provide personalised support. Committed to metascience, I integrate open science practices to ensure my research is robust and transparent. Beyond the lab, I am passionate about bridging the gap between science and education. Through Open Education initiatives, I translate complex linguistic theories into practical, evidence-based resources for researchers, teachers, and clinicians. I am dedicated to empowering the global community, supporting diverse learners in our unique and vibrant bilingual environment.\n"
