abstract: <p>The wording of definitions for terms in open scholarship and
  research practices may be inconsistent, making it difficult for researchers to
  understand and apply them accurately. This hinders clear and effective
  communication in research. To address this, we developed “Re-SearchTerms”, a
  Shiny app that encourages researchers to revisit and critically examine the
  meanings of common research terms related to open scholarship and research
  practice used in diverse research contexts. This interactive platform enables
  the exploration and comparison of definitions from multiple sources, prompting
  users to reflect on the nuanced meanings and contexts of key terms. Our
  dataset includes 2211 definitions of 216 concepts related to open scholarship,
  research practices, statistical analysis, and philosophy-of-science
  terminology. Definitions are sourced from academic texts, the crowdsourced
  FORRT glossary (Parsons et al., 2022), and Wiktionary (Meyer, 2018). Using
  natural language processing (NLP) techniques, Re-SearchTerms visualises term
  relationships based on word co-occurrences and sentence embeddings, allowing
  users to investigate co-occurrence patterns and explore concept-level
  networks. Moreover, we identify concepts with high and low semantic
  consistencies based on their definitions. Low similarity suggests variability
  in how researchers define and potentially understand a given term. This
  finding underscores the need for researchers to pay closer attention to the
  use of concepts, especially those with low consistency. Our app helps
  researchers make deliberate and informed choices when defining and
  interpreting key terms. Our adaptive framework can be applied to other
  datasets of research concepts, enabling researchers to examine and select
  terminology, especially in interdisciplinary fields.</p>
