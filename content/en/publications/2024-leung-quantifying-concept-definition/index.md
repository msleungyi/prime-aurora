abstract: '<p>Academic texts often define a given concept using words. Across
  texts, definitions may represent the same or different meanings of the given
  concept, especially for concepts in interdisciplinary fields, such as
  cognitive science. Understanding the variability of definitions and the
  reasons for this variability may facilitate the replicability of science:
  variations in concept definitions may indicate or provoke a heterogeneous
  understanding of the concept, leading to differences between studies in the
  methodology and, subsequently, the results. We developed proxy measures of the
  variability in definitions of each concept using information theory and
  natural language processing (i.e., entropy, KL divergence, and lexical
  diversity). We collected and analyzed 2212 definitions of 216 concepts
  associated with "open scholarship" as a use case study. We found strong
  correlations between the entropy-based proxy measures and the number of
  definitions and unique words yielded by concepts. However, we found no
  correlation between lexical diversity and the entropy-based proxies. This
  indicates that concepts that yield definitions with different wordings in the
  literature (high on lexical diversity) do not necessarily reflect an
  inconsistent understanding of concepts’ meaning across contexts (high on the
  entropy-based measures). The proposed methodology can help identify concepts
  that yield heterogeneous definitions in academic texts and concepts that are
  consistently defined in a semi-automated manner.</p>'
