abstract: <p>This study investigated how task format, reading comprehension
  ability, and linguistic item features influence item difficulty in
  morphological awareness (MA) assessments among adult English speakers. In our
  pre-registered study, we analysed response accuracy from 102 participants (L1
  and L2) who completed four pseudoword-based MA task types—short text, single
  sentence, picture, and word analogy—alongside a standardised reading
  comprehension test. Reading comprehension significantly predicted item
  accuracy, suggesting that individual differences in comprehension ability
  systematically affect item difficulty. Task type also significantly affected
  difficulty, with word-analogy items being the easiest. The other three types
  showed comparable difficulty. The presence of orthographic shifts did not
  significantly influence item difficulty. In contrast, morpheme type had a
  strong effect, with inflection items being easier than derivational ones.
  Among cue-related item features, the types of pseudowords and the presence of
  spelling cues in items significantly affected item difficulty. Our study calls
  for attention to task design and linguistic item features that can improve the
  psychometric qualities of MA assessments by ensuring items align with the
  intended purpose—whether to profile morphological skills or differentiate
  individual differences.</p>
