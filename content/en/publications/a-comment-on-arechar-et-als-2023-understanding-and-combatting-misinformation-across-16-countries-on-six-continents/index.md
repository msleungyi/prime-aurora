abstract: >
  In this commentary, we report the results of our computational reproduction of
  the main claims from Arechar et al. (2023), which examined psychological and
  social predictors of susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation across 16
  countries. Using the dataset and replication materials provided by the
  authors, we attempted to reproduce the study's findings using Stata (based on
  the authors' analysis script) and R (by translating and reconstructing the
  code). To assess computational reproducibility, we ran the original Stata code
  and independently reimplemented key analyses in R. While the Stata script
  allowed reproduction of several key statistical outputs, it lacked plotting
  code for most figures and required code edits for compatibility with Version
  18. In contrast, our R implementation successfully reproduced Figures 2, 3,
  4A-C, 5A-D, and 6 with visual and numerical results closely resembling those
  in the original publication. We also compared the pre-analysis plan and the
  article. We found inconsistencies in the specificity of the research
  questions, analysis scope, and terminology, making it challenging to assess
  fidelity to the preregistration. Overall, our results highlight that, while
  many of the reported statistical findings are robust to reanalysis, the
  study's graphical reproducibility could be improved by providing the complete
  code for all figures, better documentation, and ensuring greater consistency
  across the replication packages.
